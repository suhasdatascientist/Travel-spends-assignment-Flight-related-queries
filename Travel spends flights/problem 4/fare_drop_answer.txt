since there were outliers, so i don't take mean , instead i have taken median of each date against fare, and plotted scatter plot, it is clearly seen that instant fare drop has been happened on 21/07/2017 to 22/07/2017   even though I observed there is almost same fare drop from 13 to 16-07-2017, but this is not considered as instant , since the same ticket fare has been dropped for almost 3 days
